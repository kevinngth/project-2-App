## Jyggr
	Alcohol is a social lubricant. 
	My love for learning about alcohol led me to develop this project. 
	Named the project jyggr, inspired by the bartending tool used to measure liquor, a jigger. 
	jyggr is an app that keeps track of the liquor you have and your impression of it. 
	No actual connoisseur experience needed.
### Technologies Used
	Javascript
	NodeJS
	Express
	React
	Postgres
	Bootstrap 4
	Cloudinary API
	Random cocktail API
### Approach
	Started with the ERD and Wireframing
	Set up one complete circuit using MVC Framework
	Laid out all the CRUD routes for creating a collection
	Set up user registration and login verification
	Add ability for users to create notes and see other users' notes
	Refactored some pages by stacking the Edit form into the Show pages
	Added additional user friendly features such as Navbar and sorting
	Develop social feature for users

### Unsolved Problems

### User Stories
	As a collector, I need information on my collection as well as other trends in the market so that I can make an informed choice when buying to add to my collection or as a gift.
	I also want to take notes of the ones that I like and the ones that I don't so that I can avoid buyer's remorse.
